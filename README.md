# mrgreen-twitch-api StreamerEventViewer (SEV)

[Task Description](https://gist.github.com/osamakhn/14a378f3107d49de47e0b617a3d5fdf5)

## Specifications

1. The first/home page lets a user login with Twitch and set their favorite Twitch streamer name. This initiates a backend event
   listener which listens to all events for given streamer.
> After [login](https://mrgreen-twitch-api.herokuapp.com/) Twitch redirecting to [home page](https://mrgreen-twitch-api.herokuapp.com/twitch)
> To begin initiates a backend event listener need tab to button "Subscribe". This send request to `webhooks/hub`.
> But is not specified where need to show notifications! On streamer's page I can't use backend side.
> Also there is button "Streamer page" to open streamer page.

2. The second/streamer page shows an embedded livestream, chat and list of 10 most recent events for your favorite streamer. This page
   doesnâ€™t poll the backend and rather leverages web sockets and relevant Twitch API.
> For Chat and Video used Embedding iframe. To get event, without back-end side (Webhooks) 
> I [found](https://discuss.dev.twitch.tv/t/events-api-past-events/11543) unsupported/undocumented api.twitch.tv/v5/channels/{channelId}/events. But it can not returning past events.

3. Additionally please answer following questions at the bottom of your `README`:
-  How would you deploy the above on AWS? (ideally a rough architecture diagram will help)
> Firstly requirement is using containers, and it is done. PHP application have good opportunity to scaling.
> But main challenge is scaling of DB, DB is bottleneck. Configuration depends from expected loaded.
> Usual schema is - many php(application) servers,  and one or two relational dbs.

-  Where do you see bottlenecks in your proposed architecture and how would you approach scaling this app starting from 100 reqs/day to
   900MM reqs/day over 6 months?
